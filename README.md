## Features
### To have Sen or not to have
Scirate's current (20201005) font-family is : ("Sen", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif). The first one is [added](https://github.com/scirate/scirate/commit/a6e666a7ffa8519e81adcea2464b3563198382d3) early this year as requested (by someone I didn't find out).

Some people don't really like this new font, while some other love it.

You can set and save your preference by clicking the <kbd>Sci</kbd> button or do it in **Options**. **Options** can be found either by right-clicking the extension icon or in Extension - SciRate Assistant 1.0 - Details - Extension Options).

<kbd>Sci</kbd> is pop-uped when clicking the extension icon.

### Scirate on arXiv

Provide a SciRate link directly on any accessed arxiv page about one specific paper/new submissions/recent submissions/searching results. The popup becomes useless while visiting arXiv.
