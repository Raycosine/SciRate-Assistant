## Features
### To have Sen or not to have
Scirate's current (20201005) font-family is : ("Sen", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif). The first one is [added](https://github.com/scirate/scirate/commit/a6e666a7ffa8519e81adcea2464b3563198382d3) early this year as requested (by someone I didn't find out).

Some people don't really like this new font, while some other love it.

*Sen* is initially disabled while using this extension. You can save your preference for *Sen* via Options.Options can be found either by right-clicking the extension icon or Extension - SciRate Assistant 1.0 - Details - Extension Options).

Clicking the extension icon would pop up a window, where lies the button <kbd>Sci</kbd> for enabling/disabling *Sen*.

### Scirate on arXiv
